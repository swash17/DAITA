# DAITA
Data Acquisition for Intersection and Traffic Applications

DAITA can be used for collecting intersection turning movement and vehicle classification data. It was originally co-developed by Dr. Washburn and Mr. David Garber. The current version, 2.0, now incorporates the ability for data collection to be performed via mouse or finger (for touch screens). A release package will be available at this repository in the future. Until then, Email Dr. Washburn (swash@ce.ufl.edu) to obtain a copy of the program, free of charge.
